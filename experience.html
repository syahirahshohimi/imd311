<p>The experience of attending a religious school</p>
<p>I started entering Maktab Mahmud Baling in 2016. I entered the school because I followed in the footsteps of my sister who also attended school there. My experience learning about religion for five years there made me feel proud of myself for being able to maintain my image as a true Muslim until now. Even though the knowledge at Maktab Mahmud Baling is not as high as people who study at pondok or tahfiz, I still feel proud because I have the basics of religion. While in Maahad, I also have to memorize the Quran. But there are only a few surahs that are famous, namely Al-Mulk, Al-Waqiah, As-Sajdah and many more.

<p>My experience is helping my mom and dad do business</p>
My family started selling fried chicken at the end of 2021. My father decided to sell fried chicken because of the Covid-19 that hit which caused my father to have to stop the factory. My father's fried chicken business started with only 5 chickens. At the beginning of opening the store, our business was not well received. This is probably because the Covid-19 that hit caused people not to dare to go out. My father had to take a risk to sell fried chicken because he wanted to cover our siblings' schooling. At that time, my youngest sister was still small and still needed milk and pampers. This fried chicken business started on October 10, 2021 and has now been operating for almost three years. The raw chicken taken is also increasing to 30 per day and this is the biggest success for our family. I was able to continue this higher education because of the sweat of my father and mother doing business during the rain and heat. Their services to me and other siblings are really great and I cannot repay them. Now, our store is still in the process of expansion because our store also accepts food that other people want to put. Next, my father's hope in the future is to hire some workers to help our business in the future. Hopefully simplified. Chaiyok!!

<p>My experience is on vacation</p>
A mandatory activity for my family every year is to go on vacation to Malaysia. Every end and beginning of the year my father would take us on vacation to any state of our choice. Earlier that year, my father took us on vacation to Pahang, Melaka and Nilai. We only wanted to go to Pahang to visit our relatives there, but due to the long excess of time, my father took us to Melaka and Nilai. If it's a short one-week holiday, we'll only go somewhere in Kedah. Examples are Lata Bayu, Beris Lake, Pantai Merdeka and many more. We also went up Mount Jerai using a manual car. For me, my father is a strong and brave man because he was able to climb Mount Jerai using a manual car. Maybe for others it looks ordinary, but for me, father is the greatest.</p>
