My father's name is Shohimi bin Ramli. He was born on December 22, 1972 and is now 51 years old. My father is a merchant who sells fried chicken. Before this, my father was a factory operator at a wood factory but was laid off two years ago due to the fact that the factory was not in demand and could no longer operate. My father is a great and strong man and is the man I love the most. The proof is that my father took care of me until now and I am proud of him for that.
